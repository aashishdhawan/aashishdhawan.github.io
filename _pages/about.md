## Work experience

### [DSYN Media](https://yourstory.com/2013/05/startup-dsyn-builds-products-at-the-convergence-of-design-and-technology/)
I started with DSYN Media back in 2011 fresh out of the college. It was Mobility service provider. I learned a lot here and it built a great base for me to advance my career. I improved my knowledge on areas like data storage, API interactions, Core Data, mobile architectures, Objective-C patterns. Moreover I had the opportunity to develop for the Android team too which for me was a good chance to dive into the Android development.



### [AppIterate](https://yourstory.com/2015/04/flipkart-acquires-Appiterate/)
AppIterate was incubated as a product within DSYN which started out as a services firm. AppIterate was launched as an A/B testing tool for mobiles. A/B testing is a methodology to test out two variants and experiment to find out which version works better with the audience. With the world moving towards mobile, it was becoming critical to have this functionality for mobile. I built iOS SDK single handily for AppIterate.

### [ChaiOne](https://chaione.com)
Headquartered in Houston, TX, ChaiONE is an Enterprise Mobility Agency with a specific focus on the energy industry.

- Worked on many iOS projects here, peer programmed with Ben Scheirman (Chief Podcaster, NSScreencast.com).
- Worked on many other iPhone apps like RigZone, DIRigs, VeGo etc.
