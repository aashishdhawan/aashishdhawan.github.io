## Becoming a Better Programmer

It covers a number of topics that are of direct and indirect importance to working programmers, from error handling and working with unfamiliar code bases through to more nebulous issues such as teamwork and professional ethics.
I think that for someone early in their career as a programmer, Goodliffe's "Becoming a Better Programmer" may be a good investment.
