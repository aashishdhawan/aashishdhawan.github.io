Here i am trying to list books which i have read so far in year 2016.

[**Yaar Julahe....Gulzar**](http://www.amazon.in/Yaar-Julahe-Gulzar/dp/8181439740)

Gulzar is a personality who needs no introduction. Last week i got a chance to read a collection of poems written by him and this is my first book of year 2016.

This compilation mainly consists of short poems which covers many topics such as time, nature, history and philosophy. This was naturally expected from Gulzar given his experience, diversity in thoughts which covers various aspects of life.

There is one thing which i did not like about this book was that this contains first few pages of introduction, which are poorly written and dedicated to Gulzar but ignoring this fact the book is essentially a great collection specially some poems such as *Khuda, Kitaben, Adami Bulbula hai, Zindanama, Upla, Zikar Jhelam ka Hai Baat Deene Ki Hai* leave an strong impression on your mind.

[**Advanced Swift**](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/)

This is the second book which i read in this year. This is one of the [three books](https://www.objc.io/books/) written by [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/).

This is a good book which i would like to recommend to Swift developers as it covers many advanced (or rather new and interesting) ways to do common things. This will surely enhance the understanding of various features of Swift language per se.

A good read indeed.

[**Retaining Your Best People**](http://www.amazon.com/Retaining-Your-Best-People-Results/dp/1591399734)

Well...This is the third one. I picked this because title appeared interesting and promised an elixir for worldwide problem.

Few words...Just do not waste your time with this book.

[**Raavi Paar...Gulzar**](http://www.amazon.in/Raavi-Paar-Gulzar/dp/8171673899)

Fourth book of this year. This is a collection of short stories by Gulzar. Not impressed. And i am done with Gulzar. Moving on.

[**Becoming a Better Programmer**](http://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Better-Programmer-Pete-Goodliffe/dp/1491905530)

This is one good book and i would like to recommend to fellow developers specially beginners. This is undoubtably the best investment you can make early in your career. Although there are many great books in this segment but i specially loved this one because it never let you bore for a moment.

[**Bash Pocket Reference**](http://www.amazon.in/Bash-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/1449387888)

This is a small book which you can cover over weekend. I feel this can supercharge your development cycle. Worthy investment. Recommended.

[**The Ruby Programming Language**](http://www.amazon.in/Ruby-Programming-Language-Davd-Flanagan/dp/0596516177)

I was looking to add secondary skill and i narrowed down to Ruby because i was impressed by scripts written by iOS development community to help them. I feel this is a good book for beginner. Recommended.
