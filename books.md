Here i am trying to list books which i have read so far in year 2016.

[**Yaar Julahe....Gulzar**](http://www.amazon.in/Yaar-Julahe-Gulzar/dp/8181439740)

Gulzar is a personality who needs no introduction. Last week i got a chance to read a collection of poems written by him and this is my first book of year 2016.

This compilation mainly consists of short poems which covers many topics such as time, nature, history and philosophy. This was naturally expected from Gulzar given his experience, diversity in thoughts which covers various aspects of life.

There is one thing which i did not like about this book was that this contains first few pages of introduction, which are poorly written and dedicated to Gulzar but ignoring this fact the book is essentially a great collection specially some poems such as *Khuda, Kitaben, Adami Bulbula hai, Zindanama, Upla, Zikar Jhelam ka Hai Baat Deene Ki Hai* leave an strong impression on your mind.
