As an iOS developer i find bash scripts as a integral part of my development workflow. These scripts have lot of uses which include [uploading your builds](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x-tvos/how-to-upload-to-hockeyapp-from-mac-os-x), [writing Xcode run scripts](https://gist.github.com/sekati/3172554). Knowing how to write these scripts not only helps your daily iOS development efforts but can supercharge your productivity in [other](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) ways too. Therefore spending some time in learning basics of ShellScripting is an investment which has greater returns.

After learning basics of shell scripting it gave me a kind of freedom. I felt a sense of accomplishment when i was able to understand scripts being used in my app which were written by other awesome developers. Also i was able to write of couple of [scripts](https://gist.github.com/aashishdhawan/44f0438d6659a40c157fa8569c4d2a8b) for myself according to my needs.

Overall, this is a skill an iOS developer should invest over time. very useful.
