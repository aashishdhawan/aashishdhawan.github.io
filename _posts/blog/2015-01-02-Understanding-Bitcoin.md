Last week i came across a book [**Understanding Bitcoin** by Pedro Franco](). This post shares that knowledge and is intended for those people who want to understand Bitcoin better.

## 1. Prologue

Here is some interesting conversation between two guys.

A: What is Bitcoin?
B: A digital Currency.
A: And who controls it?
B: Nobody.
A: What? There must be somebody controlling it.
B: Nope. It is an algorithm.
A: Now you are confusing me. Tell me is it a currency or algorithm?
B: Both. 
A: OK then, who controls the Algorithm?
B: Nobody. It is open source.
A: Ahh..open source. Then i can make my own Bitcoins, right?. I'll become Bill Gates of Digital world.
B: Easy boy... you can't mint your own Bitcoins but you can invent your own currency.
A: But what value Bitcoins will have when anybody can create his own currency?
B: Currencies have values because of social convention, consensual agreement (or hallucination). Same goes for Euros, Dollars and Bitcoin.
A: Well.. Now you have all my attention. Please tell me more :)

### What Bitcoin is not 

* A Currency issued by an institution
* A Ponzi Scheme 
* A physical memory 
* A currency backed by silver / gold

### What Bitcoin is 

* An idea / Algorithm
* An open source project 
* A distributed peer-to-peer digital currency.
* A distributed transaction database.

## Decentralized 

Most currencies like Euro and Dollar are Fiat currencies controlled by government or semi-government institutes like banks while Bitcoin is based on peer-to-peer network of computers running the software. These computers are called nodes.

Bitcoin's decentralized nature contrasts to the structure of fiat currencies. Central banks make money decisions, regulate money flowing in market thereby influencing inflation. Control in peer-to-peer network is more subtle because these changes have to be agreed by majority of peers at least thereby make discretionary decisions almost impossible.

Another important aspect of decentralized systems are that they are robust and more resilient to any attack. This might be the reason of continuous survival of Bitcoin. 

 > The main technological breakthrough accomplished by Bitcoin is solving the double spending problem in distributed financial database.
