Last week i came across a book [**Understanding Bitcoin** by Pedro Franco](). This post shares that knowledge and is intended for those people who want to understand Bitcoin better.

## 1. Prologue

Here is some interesting conversation between two guys.

A: What is Bitcoin?
B: A digital Currency.
A: And who controls it?
B: Nobody.
A: What? There must be somebody controlling it.
B: Nope. It is an algorithm.
A: Now you are confusing me. Tell me is it a currency or algorithm?
B: Both. 
A: OK then, who controls the Algorithm?
B: Nobody. It is open source.
A: Ahh..open source. Then i can make my own Bitcoins, right?. I'll become Bill Gates of Digital world.
B: Easy boy... you can't mint your own Bitcoins but you can invent your own currency.
A: But what value Bitcoins will have when anybody can create his own currency?
B: Currencies have values because of social convention, consensual agreement (or hallucination). Same goes for Euros, Dollars and Bitcoin.
A: Well.. Now you have all my attention. Please tell me more :)
