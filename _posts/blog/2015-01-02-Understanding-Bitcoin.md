Last week i came across a book [**Understanding Bitcoin** by Pedro Franco](http://www.amazon.in/Understanding-Bitcoin-Cryptography-Engineering-Economics/dp/1119019168). This post shares that knowledge and is intended for those people who want to understand Bitcoin better.

## 1. Prologue

Here is some interesting conversation between two guys.

{% highlight java %}

A: What is Bitcoin?
B: A digital Currency.
A: And who controls it?
B: Nobody.
A: What? There must be somebody controlling it.
B: Nope. It is an algorithm.
A: Now you are confusing me. Tell me is it a currency or algorithm?
B: Both. 
A: OK then, who controls the Algorithm?
B: Nobody. It is open source.
A: Ahh..open source. Then i can make my own Bitcoins, right?. I'll become Bill Gates of Digital world.
B: Easy boy... you can't mint your own Bitcoins but you can invent your own currency.
A: But what value Bitcoins will have when anybody can create his own currency?
B: Currencies have values because of social convention, consensual agreement (or hallucination). Same goes for Euros, Dollars and Bitcoin.
A: Well.. Now you have all my attention. Please tell me more :)

### What Bitcoin is not 

* A Currency issued by an institution
* A Ponzi Scheme 
* A physical memory 
* A currency backed by silver / gold

### What Bitcoin is 

* An idea / Algorithm
* An open source project 
* A distributed peer-to-peer digital currency.
* A distributed transaction database.

### Decentralized 

Most currencies like Euro and Dollar are Fiat currencies controlled by government or semi-government institutes like banks while Bitcoin is based on peer-to-peer network of computers running the software. These computers are called nodes.

Bitcoin's decentralized nature contrasts to the structure of fiat currencies. Central banks make money decisions, regulate money flowing in market thereby influencing inflation. Control in peer-to-peer network is more subtle because these changes have to be agreed by majority of peers at least thereby make discretionary decisions almost impossible.

Another important aspect of decentralized systems are that they are robust and more resilient to any attack. This might be the reason of continuous survival of Bitcoin. 

 > The main technological breakthrough accomplished by Bitcoin is solving the double spending problem in distributed financial database.

### Open Source

### Public Asset Ledger

 * The heart of Bitcoin is a distributed database that holds a copy of common asset ledge. Every node retains a copy of this database.
 * All the information following through Bitcoin network is public. This is like making everyone's bank statement public with their names removed.

### It is not only a currency, It is a technology.

> Bitcoin is an API (Application Programming Interface) for money and bitcoin the currency is just the first application.

* Consider a use case when a computer program can open an account in a bank. This is possible using Bitcoin. Consider a autonomous agent (computer program) in cloud which charges its customers by allowing them space in cloud storage or similar technologies charging bitcoins for its service.

## 2. Technology

* Being a distributed peer-to-peer cryptocurrency Bitcoin is similar to BitTorrent in many ways which is peer-to-peer file sharing.
* Bitcoin identifies its user by Bitcoin identifiers which is a large string of letters and numbers like "13mckXcnnEd4SEkC27PnFH8dsY2gdGhRvM"
* Bitcoin addresses are not generated by network. They are created on user's device when it runs the Bitcoin software that generates the  cryptographic public and private key.
* There is no restriction on number of address a user can generate. Indeed it is recommended users generate many addresses to enhance privacy.
* No prior registration is necessary to use Bitcoin. In fact a person can send his Bitcoin address to receive funds via other communication medium like email.

### Distributed Database, The Blockchain

* Bitcoin's distributed database is called blockchain.
* Transactions are grouped in block of transactions roughly every 10 minutes.
* The block of transactions are recorded one after other in a chain of blocks, hence the name **blockChain**.
* Block are linked to create a record history of transactions that can not be altered.
* Link between blocks is a cryptographic link that cannot be forged unless attacker has vast computational power.
* Apart from blockchain, nodes keep one additional database called Unspent Transaction Output Cache (UTXO) which is a ledger that records the funds available for every address.
* The pace of new bitcoins issuances is halved every four years and it is estimated that total number of bitcoins will reach roughly 21 millions.
* A attacker needs vast amount of computational power to crack bockchain.

### Wallets 

Bitcoin wallets is a software that helps a user manage her funds, create new addresses, holds user's private keys, create transactions that are sent to network, collect incoming and outgoing transactions, to show the balance of available funds, aggregate many accounts if user has more than one account.

> Always use open source implementation of bitcoin wallet. Open source implementation reduces risk of hidden backdoors inside code.
