Well i know there are lot of books and articles on this topic written by some very prominent personalities. So why should someone waste his/her time on my post ? Well..this is what i felt in last few years and i just want to express my experience in words..nothing more.

So here are few things i feel someone should do who aspires to create a big company .

##1. Learn the difference between Manager and Leader

In my opinion these two small words are quite different in their meaning but unfortunately few of us understand this and most of us mistake one for another.  For example leader is someone who creates new opportunities, new possibilities which may not be efficient but are unprecedented endeavours and untraveled roads;  while manager “manages” the process to make it more economical, efficient and fast. Look at the various courses being taught in so-called “Management” schools . They emphasise on various tools and mathematical formulae to analyse a given business process and how to make it better. Also Look at the history of great founders and business leaders,  billionaires ; only few of them had this “Management” degree.

A leader can see behind the curve and tells where to sail ; Manger assists him to reach his goal using his skills to organise better. In short a manager stands behind a leader.

So you should ask yourself a question. Do you want to be a leader or manager in your organisation ? Define your role clearly and act accordingly.

##2. Clone yourself.

Well not that kind of cloning, not biologically.

But have you ever thought that it would be great if you can handle your development team , marketing team , or business development simultaneously? Have you ever felt that your other team leaders do not share your passion and are not dedicated to their role as you would have been? Have you ever felt a need that there should be someone like you in your organisation who thinks like you and works like you?

If answer is yes then you are looking to clone yourself and fortunately there are ways to do that.

It starts with hiring good candidates. You should hire someone who is better than you and knows much about his work than you do. If you are looking for a sales manager then hire someone who knows about selling more than you do. If you start hiring B and C then one day you will hire Z.

Other step is training. If you hire lets say fresher then take care of their training. Covert them into asset asap. train them well, ignite a desire to be great in them and they will develop passion themselves. And yes, do not hesitate to fire a wrong recruit.

Another step is talent identification and appreciation. When an organisation becomes large this becomes critical. I find most of team leaders fail to identify hidden talent within their organisation. Introverts fall under such category. Everybody talks about appreciation ; but to whom?  Beware of those employees who work less and brag much. I personally have found that introverts possess greater talent. Identify them , groom them and one day they can take your place.

Ignoring this is like killing yourself. And i bet you don’t want to kill yourself or do you ?

##3. Keep your brain in someone else’s skull.

Yes,  you read it right.

Have you ever felt that you want to learn many things but you don’t have much time? You want to read many books but life seems too short. You want to be versed in many technologies but you can’t do just yourself?

Now what if i told you there is a way to do that.

You need to teach you employees how to learn. You need to teach them how to be voracious and devour as much knowledge  as they can. If you can do this they will prove greatest asset to you and your organisation. Buying a great mind is a best  deal money can ever make. Make learning part of your organisation , your work culture and this will do wonders for you. This is like having multiple heads and all are devoted to learning new things. Isn’t it a magic?

But this does not mean that you should not learn anything. I just mean increase your brain by factor of N.

##4. Sometime Saying NO is more important then saying YES.

If you ask me one word answer for the question “What makes and breaks an organisation?” I would say “Focus”. Almost daily we have some important tasks to do which appears to be urgent but when you close your eyes and think about your Goal it becomes clear that no matter how urgent these task may be but these are not in line with your goals. Saying NO to these tasks is very important.

Some work items appears to be congruent with your goal but it is better to delegate these tasks and focus your efforts on more productive work.

##5. Ideas are more important than Technology.

After spending all my professional career in startups , i realised that when building new product; startups get lost in which technology to choose to build product. I have seen them jumping to and fro on various technologies and not taking minimal viable product to market on time and burning too much cash and time on re-inventing technologies. I have seen them worrying about scalability of their website before even putting a single page online. This really is a bad idea.

I am not saying technology is not important. Infact a lot to great companies were build on technology itself.

My point of view is that if you have expertise in say X technology and that is sufficient for your requirement then go ahead with it and don’t waste on Y because someone say Y is better than X.

Remember, customer will pay you if you can make their life better and solve their problems not because you used node.js instead of PHP or you used Django instead of Zend framework or you invented something on your own.

##6. Fire those employees who don’t enjoy their work.

Now average person spends lot of his/her time on job and job consumes a lot of part of his life. And i have seen many employees who are not happy with their company , management ,pay structure or even work they do. All they do is just complain about petty issues. Now consider this fact those employees who do not have guts to change their own life, can they transform your company ? I suggest to fire them as soon as you find them.

Now there is way to identify them. Good employees who believe in your dream, goals, company are proactive. They give you valuable suggestion even if you don’t ask them. They always get paid less as compared to work they do. They take responsibility and have their to do list ready even before you tell them what to do. While other breed of employees can be seen chatting in groups outside office building on tea spot and keep forwarding mails to other employees who are sitting next to them.

You will find proactive employees engaged in other activities related to their work apart from their office work. You will find them working part-time , participating in some open source projects, building new things on their own , writing blogs about their work or those kind of work which they are not obliged to do but they do because it interests them.
