title:  "An Ode to Code"

The beautiful ode is shamelessly copied from book [**Becoming a Better Programmer**](http://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Better-Programmer-Pete-Goodliffe/dp/1491905530). I strongly recommend this book for all inspiring developers.

*Gerald was a coder who worked in a small team.
The thing was: other coders coded code that was not clean.
The mess was detrimental, distracting, diabolic;
The inhumane detritus of an evil workaholic.*

*But Gerald had a conscience. He wouldn’t let this lie.
He lay awake at night devising schemes to rectify
The awful internal structure, the confusing variable names,
And the contrived control flow that was consistently insane.*


*Those early days the “Boy Scout Rule” was how he planned to beat
The bugs and turgid software that had formed beneath his feet.
A tidy here, a bug fix there, refactors left and right.
Pretty soon, he thought, (with work) they’ll all be out of sight.*


*But poor old Gerald, plan in action, missed one vital fact:
To make a dent, all programmers must enter in the pact.
His slapdash coding colleagues, just saw a rule to flout
And continued writing drivel whilst he tried to sort it out.*


*One step forwards, two steps back. Gerald danced this dance.
Until he learnt he needed a more militant stance.
Agile teams are excellent and clean code is the best.
To achieve this: the team, and not the code, would have to be addressed.*


*Conway’s law describes to us how software follows team
Sympathetic software is born from a well-oiled machine.
If cogs get stuck or grate, and stop doing what they ought.
Then there’s only one option: to remove them, Gerald thought.*


*So the team refactor started, with the pattern: “Parameterise from Above”:
The manager, on his cycle home, received a surprise shove.
He landed down a manhole. You might call it homocide.
Gerald called it team hygiene. One problem had then died.*


*One by one his team mates met with unusual fates.
The unsuspecting QA team were hit by flying plates.
(The lesson learned from this event was: never hold team meetings
In a diner with bad furniture, and poltergeisty leanings.)*


*The programmers who caused such ire each met a gory end.
One “caught his tie in the printer”; his face will never mend.
Another tripped atop the stairs on his way out for a break,
A pile of deadly Unix manuals flying in his wake.*

*Gerald’s life was vastly better; the team was little more
Than one coder, a sys admin, and the guy who manned the door.
The problem with this setup, Gerald shortly found:
The code got no worse—good!—but it hardly changed, as no coders were around.*


*Progress was slow and tough, though heroic Gerald tried.
Deadlines made a “whooshing” sound as often they flew by.
With features sadly lacking, the project was a farce.
Then one day a policeman came, and put Gerald behind bars.*


*The moral of this simple tale is to react with care
When callous coder colleagues deign to drive you to despair.
The only sensible way there is to retaliate
Is British: maintain a healthy level of pent-up angst and hate.*
